      "content": "# Demerits & Insurance in Alberta: What You Need to Know\n\nDemerit points are Alberta's system for tracking traffic violations. Understanding how they work and their impact on your insurance is crucial for protecting your driving record and wallet.\n\n## How Alberta's Demerit Point System Works\n\nAlberta uses a demerit point system where violations add points to your driving record:\n- **2 points**: Minor speeding, following too closely\n- **3 points**: Major speeding, distracted driving, red light violations\n- **4 points**: Excessive speeding (31+ km/h over)\n- **6 points**: Careless driving, stunting\n\n## License Suspension Thresholds\n\n- **8-14 points**: Warning letter\n- **15+ points**: License suspension\n- **Novice drivers**: Lower thresholds apply\n\n## Insurance Impact\n\n### Avoiding Insurance Hikes\n\nInsurance companies typically review driving records every 3-5 years. Here's how to minimize the impact:\n\n1. **Fight tickets strategically** - Some violations have disproportionate insurance consequences\n2. **Consider defensive driving courses** - May offset some violations\n3. **Understand your policy** - Some insurers are more forgiving than others\n\n### Average Insurance Increases\n\n- **Minor violations**: 10-20% increase\n- **Major violations**: 25-50% increase\n- **Multiple violations**: Can double your premiums\n\n## FAQ Section\n\n### How long do demerit points stay on my record?\nDemerit points remain on your Alberta driving record for 2 years from the conviction date, not the offense date.\n\n### Do photo radar tickets add demerit points?\nYes, if you're convicted of a photo radar violation, it adds the same demerit points as an officer-issued ticket for the same offense.\n\n### Can I take a course to reduce demerit points?\nAlberta doesn't have a point reduction system through courses, but some defensive driving courses may help with insurance considerations.\n\n*Protecting your driving record is protecting your financial future.*",

          "question": "How much will my insurance increase with demerit points?",
