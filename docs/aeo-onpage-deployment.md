# AEO On-Page Patterns + FAQ/PAA Implementation Guide

This document outlines the complete implementation of Block 9 from your AEO snapshot: standardized on-page patterns and FAQ/PAA question bank system for Alberta traffic ticket content pages.

## ✅ **System Overview**

The AEO On-Page system creates consistent, search engine optimized patterns for all Alberta content pages while maintaining the flexibility to customize for different cities and offence types. It's designed to maximize featured snippet eligibility and improve AEO performance.

### **Key Components Implemented**

1. **📋 AEO Pattern Configuration** (`src/config/aeoPatterns.ts`)
2. **🔧 Content Standardization Engine** (`src/lib/contentStandardizer.ts`)
3. **🤖 AEO Standardizer Automation** (`scripts/aeo-standardizer.cjs`)
4. **📄 Sample Implementation** (`data/sample-aeo-page-calgary-speeding.html`)

## 🎯 **AEO Patterns Implemented**

### **Title Pattern**
```
{Offence} Ticket in {City} — Can You Fight It? | Fabsy
```
**Examples:**
- "Speeding Ticket in Calgary — Can You Fight It? | Fabsy" ✅ 55 chars
- "Red Light Ticket in Edmonton — Can You Fight It? | Fabsy" ✅ 58 chars

### **H1 Pattern**
```
Got a {Offence} Ticket in {City}?
```
**Examples:**
- "Got a Speeding Ticket in Calgary?" ✅ 35 chars
- "Got a Red Light Ticket in Edmonton?" ✅ 36 chars

### **H2 Block Structure**
1. `Can I fight a {offence} ticket in {City}?`
2. `What to do next (60-second answer)`
3. `{City} {offence} penalties & demerits`
4. `Your options before court day`
5. `Frequently asked questions — {City} {offence}`

### **Meta Description Pattern**
```
{Offence} ticket in {City}? In many cases, Fabsy can keep demerits off your record and help you avoid insurance hikes. Zero-risk: you only pay if we win. Start a free analysis in 60 seconds.
```

## 📚 **FAQ/PAA Question Bank**

### **Generic Questions (All Offences)**
1. "Can I fight a {offence} ticket in {City}?"
2. "Do I have to go to court for a {offence} ticket in {City}?"
3. "How many demerits for {offence} in {City}?"
4. "Will my insurance go up for a {offence} ticket?"
5. "What's the deadline to act on a {offence} ticket?"

### **Offence-Specific Questions**
- **Speeding:** Photo-radar specifics, fine reduction options
- **Red Light:** Camera vs officer-issued differences
- **Distracted Driving:** Negotiation possibilities
- **Careless Driving:** Criminal vs traffic clarification
- **Seatbelt:** Insurance impact details

### **City Tone Guidelines**
- **Calgary:** Explicit city mentions in H1, Answer Box, first paragraph
- **Edmonton:** Mirror user phrasing like "Edmonton speeding ticket options"
- **Smaller Cities:** Note that small-city tickets can still be resolved

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Pattern Generation System**

```typescript
// Generate standardized content for any city/offence combination
const tokens: AEOPageTokens = {
  City: "Calgary",
  Offence: "Speeding", 
  offence: "speeding"
};

const content = generatePageContent(tokens);
// Returns: title, h1, h2_blocks, meta_description, faqs, schema, etc.
```

### **FAQ Schema Generation**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can I fight a speeding ticket in Calgary?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Often, yes. Many cases can be resolved to avoid a conviction that affects your record or insurance."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Content Validation System**

- ✅ **Title Length:** 45-62 characters
- ✅ **H1 Length:** ≤65 characters  
- ✅ **Meta Description:** 120-160 characters
- ✅ **FAQ Schema:** 2-3 questions for Rich Results
- ✅ **On-Page FAQs:** 3 questions (1 generic + 2 offence-specific)

## 🤖 **Automation Features**

### **AEO Standardizer Script**

The automation script (`aeo-standardizer.cjs`) provides:

- **🔍 Content Auditing:** Analyzes existing pages against AEO standards
- **📊 Scoring System:** 100-point scale with detailed issue breakdown
- **🎯 Priority Identification:** Highlights pages most needing AEO work
- **📈 Recommendations:** Actionable steps to improve each page
- **📋 Reporting:** Comprehensive reports with statistics and trends

### **Sample Audit Results**

```
📊 Score Distribution:
   Average score: 77.7/100
   High (90+): 0 pages
   Medium (70-89): 3 pages  
   Low (<70): 0 pages

⚠️ Common Issues:
   AEO: Meta description could be optimized with AEO pattern (3 pages)
   AEO: Title does not match AEO pattern (2 pages)
   AEO: Missing FAQ section for featured snippet optimization (2 pages)
   AEO: Missing Answer Box module (2 pages)
```

## 📄 **Above-the-Fold Requirements**

Every AEO-optimized page includes:

1. **✅ Standardized H1** following the pattern
2. **✅ Answer Box Module** directly below H1 with:
   - Content snippet using the pattern
   - Primary CTA visible without scrolling
   - City + offence echoed prominently
3. **✅ First Paragraph** includes exact "ticket" + "{offence}" + "{City}" terms

### **Answer Box Example**

```html
<div class="answer-box" data-city="Calgary" data-offence="speeding">
  <p>Short answer: Yes — many Calgary speeding tickets can be fixed before your court date. Upload your ticket, we pull your court file, then confirm options to protect your record.</p>
  <button class="cta-primary">Get a free analysis →</button>
</div>
```
