  "what": "<p>A stop sign ticket, often issued under the Alberta Traffic Safety Act for failing to make a complete stop, can result in demerit points and a fine. These tickets are not just minor inconveniences; they can impact your driving record and potentially lead to increased insurance premiums. Understanding your rights and options when faced with such a ticket is crucial.</p><p>In Alberta, the legal system provides mechanisms for individuals to dispute traffic violations. This means you don't have to simply accept the ticket; you have the right to challenge it in court. Whether you believe you made a full stop, the signage was unclear, or there were other mitigating circumstances, exploring your options is a valid course of action.</p>",
  "how": "<p>Fighting a stop sign ticket in Alberta involves several steps. Initially, you will need to enter a plea of 'not guilty' by the deadline indicated on your ticket. This typically leads to a court date where you can either attempt to negotiate with the prosecutor or proceed to a trial.</p><p>During negotiations, a prosecutor might offer a reduced fine or a lesser charge, especially if it's your first offence or if there are weaknesses in the prosecution's case. If a resolution isn't reached, your case will proceed to trial. At trial, you'll have the opportunity to present your defence, question the ticketing officer, and call any witnesses. Common defences include challenging the officer's observation, arguing that the stop sign was obscured, or presenting evidence that you did, in fact, make a complete stop.</p>",
  "next": "<p>If you've received a stop sign ticket in Alberta, the next step is to carefully review your options. Consider the details of the incident, gather any potential evidence (like dashcam footage or witness contact information), and decide whether you want to fight the ticket yourself or seek assistance.
