  "what": "<p>A \"Fail to Carry Proof of Registration of License Plate\" ticket in Alberta means you were unable to provide immediate proof of your vehicle's current registration or the valid registration for your license plate when requested by a law enforcement officer. This is a regulatory offense, and while it doesn't typically carry demerit points, it does come with a significant fine, as you've experienced with your $462 ticket.</p><p>The law requires drivers to always have their vehicle's registration documents accessible while operating the vehicle. This ensures that the vehicle is legally allowed on the road and that the owner is accountable.</p>",
  "how": "<p>Disputing your ticket involves notifying the court of your intention to plead not guilty or to seek a resolution. This usually means checking the 'Request a hearing' or 'Plead not guilty' box on the back of your ticket and submitting it to the court by the specified due date. Once you do this, you will receive a Notice of Hearing with a court date.</p><p>At the hearing, you will have the opportunity to explain your situation to the prosecutor or the judge. This could include showing that you had the proof but it was misplaced, or that there was a misunderstanding. Sometimes, prosecutors are willing to negotiate a reduced fine or an alternative resolution if you have a reasonable explanation or if you can subsequently provide the missing documentation.</p>",
  "next": "<p>Your next step is to carefully review your ticket for the deadline to respond. You typically have 30 days from the date of the ticket to enter a plea or request a hearing. Gather any evidence that supports your case, such as the actual proof of registration if you found it, or any documents explaining why it wasn't available at the time. Consider whether you want to represent yourself or have an agent assist you.</p><p>If you'd like a human review, upload your ticket.</p>",
