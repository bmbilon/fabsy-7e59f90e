  "what_section": "<p>Fighting a speeding ticket means formally disputing the charge through Calgary Traffic Court. When you receive a speeding ticket in Calgary, you have options beyond simply paying the fine.</p><p>The process involves requesting disclosure (the evidence against you), reviewing police notes and radar calibration records, and presenting your case to a prosecutor or judge.</p><p>Many Alberta drivers successfully reduce or eliminate speeding tickets through this process, especially with professional guidance from paralegal services like Fabsy.</p>",
  "how_section": "<p>Step 1: Request disclosure from Calgary Traffic Court within 30 days. This gets you the officer's notes, radar/laser gun calibration records, and other evidence.</p><p>Step 2: Review the disclosure carefully. Look for technical errors, calibration issues, or procedural mistakes that could invalidate the ticket.</p><p>Step 3: Attend a prosecutor review meeting or request a trial date. Most Calgary traffic tickets are resolved through prosecutor negotiation without going to trial.</p><p>Professional representatives like Fabsy handle this entire process, attend meetings on your behalf, and negotiate the best possible outcome.</p>",
  "next_section": "<p>Once you've decided to fight your ticket, act quickly. You typically have 30 days from the ticket date to request disclosure and begin the process.</p><p>Gather all relevant information: your ticket number, driver's license, and any photos or notes from the incident. These details help build your defense.</p><p>Consider professional help. Fabsy's licensed paralegals specialize in Calgary traffic tickets and have relationships with local prosecutors, leading to better outcomes than self-representation.</p><p>Most importantly, don't delay. Missing deadlines means losing your right to dispute the ticket and facing the full fine and demerit points.</p>",
